As machine learning has become more and more ubiquitous over recent years,
it has come to play a greater and greater role in our lives. From the social
media posts we see, to the systems that monitor bank accounts for financial
fraud, this technology plays an important role in many of the technological
systems of the day. This project has no such high-minded goals, however. Our
algorithm will learn to do one thing, and one thing only.

Play Frogger.

This project will seek to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger, and then
build a machine learning AI to play it through the use of a genetic training
algorithm and neural network. The game and the AI will be built in Python,
using Pygame and Tensorflow.

# Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 (Note: newer versions will not work)

# Initial Setup

- Clone repository
- Open terminal on repository root directory
- `python --version` to verify python 3.7
- `python -m venv venv && "venv\Scripts\activate.bat" && pip install -r requirements.txt`
  to install dependencies
- `python src\main.py` to run

# Unit Testing

This project will primarily make use of the built-in Python unit testing framework.
All unit testing source should be placed in src\Unittests.
