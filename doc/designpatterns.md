# Design Patterns

For Froggerithm what we have used and will use in the future 
falls under the Behavioral Design Patterns. 
The sprite objects can be considered a collection.
The function that calls them is considered an Iterator 
because it does not expose the internal structure of 
sprites being created.  

Observer patterns is used when the sprites are rendered,
and the display is updated. The display includes everything 
tied to it such as the background, all the sprites, the obstacles,
timer and window. They are notified and updated automatically.
