# Project Reflections


## John Cooke Project Reflections 
As the most experienced developer on my team, this project was my first opportunity 
to take a leadership role on a development team. I had worked with teams on other
projects before, but never in a leadership position, so I was excited about
the opportunity to architect and lead a project. Additionally, I've never done any
actual projects in machine learning, only read a lot about theory. These things 
combined meant that this project was a great chance to learn a lot, both about myself
and about an interesting topic within computer science. 

Most of my contributions to the project involved core game engine functions such as
collision detection, sprite spawning and movement, and the rendering system. I also
handled laying out the general structure of the project, and much of the work
involving the machine learning portion of the project was handled by me as well.

In the end, I learned a lot about how to structure and design a machine learning 
system, and how to design your systems to incentivize the AI to accomplish the task.
Working with the automated unit testing system, and the number of times it exposed
that I was clueless about, also cemented the importance of automated unit testing
in my mind.

## Zion Emond Project Reflections 
This project was one of the first big group development projects I had done.
I was familiar with git and general source control concepts, but I had never really
used them much before. One of my biggest takeaways from this project is the experience
working on a development project in a group while using git to manage our code and while
using the Scrum method of development.

The biggest parts of the project that I contributed were the graphics for the game
as well as most of the code that related to the player functionality. Additionally,
I added the sound effects and music to the game.

I learned a lot about the ins and outs of the pygame engine as well as general things about
the Python language. I had never used or learned about unit testing before, so adding the unit
tests for the sections of code I wrote helped me learn a lot about Test-Driven Development.

## Alex Stiner Project Reflections 
Before starting on this project I had not had 
alot of experience with python. The task for 
creating the authors and license document were
straight forward and easy to complete. The project 
proposal was important in creating a concise plan 
on what we wanted to do for our project and how we 
were going about it. The design patterns we connected 
Behavioral Design Patterns with what we would be using 
with the sprites and functions in our project. 

I worked on the sprint.md files 
with John and Zion after each which helped in our 
discussions of what we planned to do each sprint, 
what was completed on the last sprint and how long 
it would take to work on the next tasks for the next sprint.
The reviews helped us to stay on task, but they also 
helped in giving a clear understanding on what each member 
was responsible for and how long it would take on each of 
their assigned tasks. 

When creating the game my tasks included creating 
the car-spawning function, creating the car sprites
and creating the unit tests for the car spawning. Completing 
each of these tasks were a real challenge. I learned how 
python works. What was the most fun for me once I got through
the frustration was creating the car-spawning function because
I was really cool to see that I created a part of the code in 
which effected the animation to move across a screen. I had not done that before, 
and it was satisfying once it worked.
The timer code was straight forward, but getting it to 
countdown and change the numbers
without just overlapping the numbers was a bit of a challenge. 

The unit tests were challenging to create, but discussing with my team
different thoughts I had on how to go about it, I was able to 
create it. Creating the start screen and game over screen code to 
was straight forward, but figuring out where they needed to go took 
some thought. Also, when creating the start screen code I had to determine 
what action that would cause it to switch from the start screen
to the game screen.
