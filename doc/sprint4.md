  ## Retro
    
  ### Good
  
  * We were ahead of schedule enough on the project as a whole that we are able to have time in future sprints to finish tasks.
  * We stayed up to date on our documentation.  
   
  ### Bad

  * We ran out of time for some of the tasks planned for this sprint.
    
  ### Actionable Commitments
  
  * We want to have the AI finshed by the end of this sprint.
  * We want to finish up the documentation by the end of this sprint.
